# convert-to-binary
 Takes in a positive integer and outputs binary string.

## Challenge:
Write a program that takes in a positive integer as input, and outputs a string of 1's and 0's representing the integer in binary. For an integer x, the algorithm is:

As long as x is greater than 0
   Output x modulo 2 (remainder is either 0 or 1)
   Assign x with x divided by 2
Note: The above algorithm outputs the 0's and 1's in reverse order.

Ex: If the input is:
6

the output is:

011

6 in binary is 110; the algorithm outputs the bits in reverse.
